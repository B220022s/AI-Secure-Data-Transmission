# AI-Powered Secure Data Transmission System ðŸ”’ðŸ¤–

## ðŸŒŸ Overview
This project introduces a revolutionary method for securing data transmission using artificial intelligence. The system converts data into a non-human-readable format (e.g., neural embeddings or homomorphic encryption), making it immune to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, packet sniffing, and unauthorized manipulations.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **AI-Based Obfuscation**: Data is transformed into high-dimensional neural representations.
- **Tamper-Proof Guardian Signature**: Each data packet includes a cryptographic hash combined with an AI-generated signature.
- **Automatic Recovery**: If tampering is detected, the system automatically restores the original data.
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Utilizes IPFS or blockchain for storing original data to avoid single points of failure.

## ðŸ”§ Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `hashlib`, `json`

### Running the Proof of Concept
```bash
git clone https://github.com/B220022s/AI-Secure-Data-Transmission.git
cd AI-Secure-Data-Transmission
python src/secure_packet.py.
